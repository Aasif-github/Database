---

## **ðŸ”¹ 3. Child Registration & Immunization Implementation**
### **ðŸš€ Step 1: Child Registration API**
- Health workers use the **mobile/web app** to register a child.  
- API stores: **Child Name, Date of Birth, Parent Details, Location, Unique ID**.  
- Data is stored in **MongoDB**, indexed for **fast retrieval**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example API (Express.js + Mongoose):**
```javascript
// Child Registration API
router.post("/register-child", async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { name, dob, parentDetails, location } = req.body;
        const child = new Child({ name, dob, parentDetails, location });
        await child.save();
        res.status(201).json({ message: "Child registered successfully", child });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: "Error registering child", error });
    }
});
```

---

### **ðŸš€ Step 2: Immunization Record API**
- After a child is registered, their **vaccination history is stored**.  
- API supports **adding, updating, and retrieving immunization details**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example API (Storing Immunization Records):**
```javascript
// Add Immunization Record API
router.post("/add-vaccine", async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { childId, vaccineName, dateGiven, nextDueDate } = req.body;
        const immunization = new Immunization({ childId, vaccineName, dateGiven, nextDueDate });
        await immunization.save();
        res.status(201).json({ message: "Immunization record added", immunization });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: "Error adding immunization record", error });
    }
});
```

---

### **ðŸš€ Step 3: Automated Immunization Reminders (Cron Job)**
- The system **sends alerts** when a childâ€™s next vaccination is due.  
- A **cron job runs daily** to check for upcoming due dates.  
- Notifications are sent via **SMS/WhatsApp API integration**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example Cron Job (Node.js + Node-Cron):**
```javascript
const cron = require("node-cron");
const Immunization = require("./models/Immunization");
const sendNotification = require("./utils/sendNotification");

// Run the job every day at 9 AM
cron.schedule("0 9 * * *", async () => {
    const today = new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0];
    const dueVaccines = await Immunization.find({ nextDueDate: today });

    dueVaccines.forEach((record) => {
        sendNotification(record.parentContact, `Reminder: ${record.vaccineName} due for your child today.`);
    });
});
```
---

### **ðŸš€ Step 4: Offline Data Handling & Auto-Sync**
- **Health workers in remote areas** may not have **internet access** at all times.  
- Data is **stored locally** and syncs **when the connection is restored**.  
- Implemented **BullMQ (Redis Queue)** to handle background sync.  

ðŸ“Œ **Offline Sync Logic in Node.js**
```javascript
// Sync Offline Data when Internet is Available
const { Queue, Worker } = require("bullmq");

const syncQueue = new Queue("syncQueue");

const syncWorker = new Worker("syncQueue", async (job) => {
    const { childData } = job.data;
    await Child.create(childData);
});

async function addToSyncQueue(childData) {
    await syncQueue.add("syncChild", { childData });
}
```
---

## **ðŸ”¹ 4. Challenges & Solutions**
### **ðŸš¨ Challenge 1: Ensuring Data Sync for Offline Workers**
- **Problem:** Health workers in remote areas struggle to sync immunization records.
