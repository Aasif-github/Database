## Project: Resale Product Portal (C2C Marketplace) – Microservices 
Description:
Developed a C2C resale marketplace similar to eBay, enabling users to buy and sell new or used products within specific price ranges. Implemented a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.
Client: UAE
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Typescript, Serverless(v3), HTTP-API, AWS (EC2, Lambda, SNS, SQS, CDK,CloudFormation, SDK, SAM-CLI, RDS, CloudFront, S3), MongoDB, MySQL, Docker.

--- 

Architectural pattern:
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is an architectural pattern that separates the read (query) and write (command) operations of a system into two separate models.

This means:
✅ Commands (Write operations) handle data modifications (Create, Update, Delete).
✅ Queries (Read operations) handle data retrieval (Read operations).


- Nodejs. Typescript,  
- HTTP-API(AWS-Api-gateway) with aws-lambda[framework(for offline):serverless-3]
