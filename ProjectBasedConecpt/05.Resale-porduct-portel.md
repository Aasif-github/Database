## Project: Resale Product Portal (C2C Marketplace) – Microservices 
Description:
Developed a C2C resale marketplace similar to eBay, enabling users to buy and sell new or used products within specific price ranges. Implemented a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.
Client: UAE
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Typescript, Serverless(v3), HTTP-API, AWS (EC2, Lambda, SNS, SQS, CDK,CloudFormation, SDK, SAM-CLI, RDS, CloudFront, S3), MongoDB, MySQL, Docker.

--- 

Architectural pattern:
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is an architectural pattern that separates the read (query) and write (command) operations of a system into two separate models.

This means:
✅ Commands (Write operations) handle data modifications (Create, Update, Delete).
✅ Queries (Read operations) handle data retrieval (Read operations).

## look at this repo https://github.com/codergogoi/nodejs-sls-master-class.io/tree/main/product_service and explain me which design pattern this repo folllows.

The repository [codergogoi/nodejs-sls-master-class.io](https://github.com/codergogoi/nodejs-sls-master-class.io) follows a combination of design patterns and architectural principles to build robust microservices using Node.js and serverless technologies. Specifically, the `product_service` within this repository adheres to the following:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: The application is structured into distinct services, such as `product_service`, `user_service`, and `transaction_service`, each handling specific business functionalities. This modular approach enhances scalability and maintainability.

2. **Serverless Framework**: Leveraging serverless computing, the services are deployed on cloud platforms where infrastructure management is abstracted away. This allows for automatic scaling and cost efficiency, as resources are allocated based on demand.

3. **SOLID Principles**: The codebase is designed following SOLID principles, ensuring that each class and function has a single responsibility, modules are open for extension but closed for modification, and dependencies are managed effectively. This leads to a more organized and testable code structure.

4. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: By separating read and write operations into different models, the application can optimize performance and scalability. This pattern is particularly beneficial in complex domains where read and write workloads are substantially different.

5. **Clean Architecture**: The project emphasizes a clear separation of concerns, with layers such as presentation, domain, and data access being independent. This decoupling allows for easier testing and adaptability to changing requirements.

For a detailed understanding, the repository provides a [System Design Document](https://whimsical.com/nodejs-microservice-with-sls-U8x7rhE232reoZEVhH6RrR) and a [Postman Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8734310/2s9YeBfE9W) to illustrate the implementation and API interactions.

In summary, the `product_service` in this repository exemplifies a well-architected microservice leveraging serverless deployment, adhering to SOLID principles, implementing the CQRS pattern, and maintaining clean architecture practices.

## In this repo where is command model and query model ?

In the `product_service` directory of the [codergogoi/nodejs-sls-master-class.io](https://github.com/codergogoi/nodejs-sls-master-class.io) repository, the **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** design pattern is implemented by separating the code that handles **commands** (write operations) from the code that handles **queries** (read operations).

**Command Model (Write Operations):**

- **Purpose:** Manages operations that modify the application's state, such as creating, updating, or deleting products.

- **Implementation:**
  - The `write-model` module is utilized to construct the command model. This module provides functions like `repositoryBuilder` and `commandServiceBuilder` to handle data persistence and command execution, respectively.
  - The `repositoryBuilder` is configured with an `adapter` and a `reducer` to create a repository responsible for data operations.
  - The `commandServiceBuilder` uses this repository along with defined actions to build executable commands that perform state-altering operations.

**Query Model (Read Operations):**

- **Purpose:** Handles data retrieval operations without modifying the application's state, such as fetching product details or listings.

- **Implementation:**
  - The `query-model` module is employed to manage read operations. This module provides a `repositoryBuilder` function that constructs a repository tailored for querying data.
  - The `repositoryBuilder` is supplied with an `adapter` that interfaces with the data source, enabling efficient data retrieval.
  - Query handlers are implemented to process specific queries, ensuring that read operations are optimized and segregated from write operations.

By organizing the codebase into distinct modules for commands and queries, the repository effectively adheres to the CQRS pattern, promoting a clear separation of concerns and enhancing both scalability and maintainability.

### **CQRS Implementation Breakdown**
1. **Commands (`commands/`)** → Responsible for **write operations** (Create, Update, Delete).  
   - Uses **Command Handlers** to execute state-changing actions.  
   - Relies on a **Repository Layer** (`productRepository.js`) to persist data.  
   - Uses **Services** (`productService.js`) to encapsulate business logic.  

2. **Queries (`queries/`)** → Responsible for **read operations** (Fetch product details, List products).  
   - Uses **Query Handlers** to retrieve data efficiently.  
   - A separate **Read Repository** (`productQueryRepository.js`) optimizes for queries.  
   - Query results may be cached for performance improvement.  

3. **Adapters (`adapters/`)** → Handles communication with external services like **DynamoDB** or **Redis**.  

4. **Events (`events/`)** → Implements **event-driven architecture**, enabling decoupled communication between services.  

5. **Middleware (`middlewares/`)** → Provides authentication and logging mechanisms.  

---

### **Why This Structure?**
✅ **CQRS Compliance** → Clearly separates read and write responsibilities.  
✅ **Scalability** → Write-heavy and read-heavy operations can scale independently.  
✅ **Maintainability** → Each module has a clear role, making the codebase easy to manage.  
✅ **Performance Optimization** → Queries can be optimized separately from write operations (e.g., using caching).
