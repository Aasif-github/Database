Architectural pattern:
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is an architectural pattern that separates the read (query) and write (command) operations of a system into two separate models.

This means:
✅ Commands (Write operations) handle data modifications (Create, Update, Delete).
✅ Queries (Read operations) handle data retrieval (Read operations).
