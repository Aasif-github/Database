## ORM
Object Relation Mapper (ORM) is a design pattern that maps objects to database tables and vice versa. It is used to map database entities to object models.

The main goal of ORM is to provide a way to access and manipulate data in a database using object-oriented programming concepts.

It allows developers to work with objects instead of raw SQL queries, which makes the code more readable and maintainable.

`Squelize` is a popular ORM library for Node.js that provides a set of tools and APIs for interacting with a database using a SQL-like query language.

It supports a wide range of database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.

## ODM  
Object Document Mapper (ODM) is a design pattern that maps objects to database documents and vice versa. It is used to map database entities to object models.

The main goal of ODM is to provide a way to access and manipulate data in a database using object-oriented programming concepts.

`Mongoose` is a popular ODM library for Node.js that provides a set of tools and APIs for interacting with a MongoDB database.

It supports a wide range of database engines, including MongoDB, Mongoose, and more.
