## Mongodb - Full Text Search
[Full Text Search](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/full-text-search)

### How does full-text searching work?

- To perform full-text searching in a database, an index must be created. The index acts as a glossary of all the words in the indexed fields with reference to the specific documents. When a query is performed, the engine searches the index and finds all matching documents.
