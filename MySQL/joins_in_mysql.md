### ‚úÖ What is a JOIN in MySQL?

A **JOIN** in MySQL is used to **combine rows from two or more tables** based on a related column between them (usually a foreign key).

It allows you to query data that is spread across multiple tables as if it were in a single table.

### üîÑ Why Use JOINs?

Relational databases are normalized‚Äîdata is stored in separate tables to reduce redundancy. `JOIN` lets you bring related data together.

### üìö Types of Joins in MySQL

| Join Type           | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **INNER JOIN**      | Returns rows with matching values in both tables.                                                    |
| **LEFT JOIN**       | Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table (or `NULL` if no match). |
| **RIGHT JOIN**      | Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left table (or `NULL` if no match). |
| **FULL OUTER JOIN** | Not directly supported in MySQL. Simulated using `UNION` of `LEFT` and `RIGHT` joins.                |
| **CROSS JOIN**      | Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (all combinations of rows).                             |
| **SELF JOIN**       | A table joined to itself (used for hierarchical or relational comparison).                           |

### üîç Quick Examples

#### 1. **INNER JOIN**

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

‚Üí Only matched records from both tables.

---

#### 2. **LEFT JOIN**

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

‚Üí All employees, even those without departments.

---

#### 3. **RIGHT JOIN**

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

‚Üí All departments, even if no employees are assigned.

---

#### 4. **FULL OUTER JOIN** *(Simulated)*

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
UNION
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

---

#### 5. **CROSS JOIN**

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN departments d;
```

‚Üí Every employee paired with every department.
