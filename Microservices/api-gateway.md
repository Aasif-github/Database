### **What is an API Gateway?**
An **API Gateway** is a server that acts as a single entry point for client requests to multiple backend services. It is responsible for **routing, authentication, rate limiting, caching, logging, and monitoring** API requests.

### **Why Use an API Gateway?**
- **Single Entry Point**: Instead of clients interacting with multiple microservices, they communicate with a single API Gateway.
- **Security**: Implements authentication and authorization (JWT, OAuth, API keys, etc.).
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**: Controls how many requests a client can make within a time frame.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple backend servers to prevent overloading.
- **Caching**: Reduces latency by storing frequently requested responses.
- **Request Transformation**: Converts client requests before forwarding them to the backend (e.g., REST to gRPC).
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Tracks API usage and errors for debugging and analytics.

### **How API Gateway Works**
1. A client (browser, mobile app, or another service) sends a request.
2. The API Gateway authenticates the request.
3. It routes the request to the appropriate backend service.
4. The response from the backend is processed and transformed if needed.
5. The API Gateway sends the response back to the client.

### **Popular API Gateway Solutions**
- **AWS API Gateway** (for serverless architectures)
- **NGINX** (lightweight and high-performance)
- **Kong API Gateway** (open-source with plugins)
- **Traefik** (cloud-native API gateway)
- **Apigee** (enterprise-grade API gateway by Google Cloud)

### **Use Case in Your Project**
Since you are working with **Node.js, Express, and Socket.io**, you can use **AWS API Gateway** if you're deploying a serverless setup or **Kong/NGINX** if you're hosting on **EC2**.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Choosing the Right API Gateway**
Since you're hosting your app on **AWS EC2**, the best API Gateway options are:
1. **AWS API Gateway** (if using AWS Lambda or serverless architecture)
2. **NGINX or Kong** (if using EC2 with Express.js)

Since your app is a **real-time booking system with Socket.io**, AWS API Gateway may not be the best choice because it doesn't support WebSockets well. Instead, **NGINX or Kong** will work better.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up API Gateway with NGINX (Recommended for EC2 Hosting)**
NGINX is a lightweight and powerful API Gateway that works well for **Express.js and WebSockets**.

### **Step 1: Install NGINX on EC2**
SSH into your EC2 instance and run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nginx
```

### **Step 2: Configure NGINX as an API Gateway**
Edit the NGINX config file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Replace the contents with:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name bookMydoc.life;

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;  # Your Express.js backend
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /socket.io/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/socket.io/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```
This will:
‚úÖ Route API requests (`/api/`) to your Express.js backend.  
‚úÖ Support WebSocket connections (`/socket.io/`) for real-time updates.  

### **Step 3: Enable the Configuration and Restart NGINX**
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Security & Rate Limiting**
To **prevent abuse**, enable rate limiting in NGINX:

1. Open the config file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   ```
2. Add the following inside the `http {}` block:
   ```nginx
   limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api_limit:10m rate=5r/s;
   ```
3. Apply it to API routes:
   ```nginx
   location /api/ {
       limit_req zone=api_limit burst=10;
       proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
   }
   ```
This limits each IP to **5 requests per second** with a **burst limit of 10**.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up SSL (HTTPS) with Let‚Äôs Encrypt**
For a secure connection:
1. Install Certbot:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   ```
2. Get an SSL certificate:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d bookMydoc.life -d www.bookMydoc.life
   ```
3. Auto-renew:
   ```bash
   sudo crontab -e
   ```
   Add:
   ```bash
   0 0 1 * * certbot renew --quiet
   ```

---

## **Final Steps**
‚úÖ **Test your API Gateway:**  
- Open your browser and visit `http://bookMydoc.life/api/`  
- Test WebSockets with `wss://bookMydoc.life/socket.io/`

‚úÖ **Deploy your backend on PM2** to keep it running:
```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start server.js
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

---

## **Conclusion**
With NGINX and Let's Encrypt, you have a secure and reliable API Gateway for your Express.js backend, ready to handle real-time updates with Socket.io.
