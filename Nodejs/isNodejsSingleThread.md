**Node.js** is fundamentally **single-threaded** for executing JavaScript code but can also utilize **multiple threads** in specific scenarios, making it a hybrid model. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Single-Threaded Nature**
- The **JavaScript execution in Node.js** happens on a single thread, known as the **main thread**.
- Node.js uses an **event-driven, non-blocking I/O model** to handle multiple operations concurrently without the need for multiple threads.

---

### **Multi-Threaded Internals**
1. **libuv and Thread Pool**:
   - Node.js uses the **libuv library**, which internally creates a thread pool (default size is 4) for performing blocking tasks, such as:
     - File I/O
     - DNS lookups
     - Cryptographic operations (e.g., hashing)

2. **Worker Threads**:
   - Node.js introduced the **Worker Threads module** (in version 10.5.0) to enable JavaScript code to run on separate threads for CPU-intensive tasks.
   - These threads do not share memory directly with the main thread but can communicate using message passing.

---

### Practical Summary
- **Single-Threaded** for JavaScript execution (event loop processes tasks).
- **Multi-Threaded** for handling I/O operations (via libuv thread pool) and optional worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks.

### Example of Single vs Multi-Thread Usage

#### **Single-Threaded I/O Handling**:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

console.log('Start reading file...');

// Non-blocking file read
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('File read complete:', data);
});

console.log('Continuing with other tasks...');
```

**Output**:
1. "Start reading file..."
2. "Continuing with other tasks..."
3. "File read complete: ..." (after file is read asynchronously).

#### **Using Worker Threads for Multi-Threading**:
```javascript
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

function runWorkerTask() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const worker = new Worker('./worker-task.js'); // Separate thread
        worker.on('message', resolve);
        worker.on('error', reject);
    });
}

runWorkerTask().then((result) => {
    console.log('Worker result:', result);
});
```

**worker-task.js**:
```javascript
const { parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

// Simulate a CPU-intensive task
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) sum += i;

parentPort.postMessage(sum);
```

**Output**:
The main thread remains free while the worker thread computes the result.

---

### Conclusion
- Node.js is **single-threaded** for JavaScript execution via the event loop.
- It uses **multi-threading** internally for I/O operations (libuv) and explicitly through **Worker Threads** for CPU-bound tasks.
