## Difference between `setImmediate()` and `process.nextTick()`;


The key difference between `setImmediate()` and `process.nextTick()` in Node.js lies in **when they are executed within the Event Loop cycle**. 

---

### **1. `setImmediate()`**
- **Execution Timing**:
  - Executes callbacks in the **check phase** of the Event Loop.
  - Scheduled to run after the I/O operations and other phases are completed.

- **Primary Use**:
  - To execute a callback **after the current event loop phase ends**, ensuring all pending I/O tasks and timers are handled first.

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  setImmediate(() => {
    console.log('setImmediate executed');
  });

  console.log('Code executed');
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  Code executed
  setImmediate executed
  ```

---

### **2. `process.nextTick()`**
- **Execution Timing**:
  - Executes callbacks immediately after the current operation, **before moving to the next phase of the Event Loop**.
  - `process.nextTick()` adds the callback to a microtask queue, which has higher priority than the phases of the Event Loop.

- **Primary Use**:
  - To execute a callback **immediately after the current operation completes**, even before I/O events or timers.

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  process.nextTick(() => {
    console.log('process.nextTick executed');
  });

  console.log('Code executed');
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  Code executed
  process.nextTick executed
  ```

### **Key Differences**:
| Feature                  | `setImmediate()`                 | `process.nextTick()`             |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Execution Priority**   | Executes in the next Event Loop iteration during the **check phase**. | Executes **immediately after the current operation** within the same phase. |
| **Phase**                | Runs during the **check phase** of the Event Loop. | Part of the **microtask queue**, higher priority than any Event Loop phase. |
| **Use Case**             | When you want to defer execution to the next loop iteration. | When you need to prioritize a callback before I/O or timers. |
| **Impact on Event Loop** | Does not block subsequent microtasks or other Event Loop phases. | Can delay I/O or timers if heavily used, as it runs before other tasks. |

---

### **Combined Example**:
```javascript
setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('setImmediate');
});

process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log('process.nextTick');
});

console.log('Code executed');
```

**Output**:
```
Code executed
process.nextTick
setImmediate
```

---

### **Summary**:
- **`process.nextTick()`** is for callbacks that need to be executed immediately after the current operation and before I/O or timers.
- **`setImmediate()`** is for callbacks that should be executed in the next iteration of the Event Loop after I/O operations.

Use `process.nextTick()` for high-priority tasks and `setImmediate()` for deferring execution without blocking the Event Loop.
