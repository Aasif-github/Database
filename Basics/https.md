# What is HTTP?
### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It is designed to be simple, stateless, and extensible.

---

### **Key Features of HTTP:**

1. **Stateless Protocol**  
   Each request from a client to a server is independent. The server does not retain session information about the client between requests unless explicitly handled using mechanisms like cookies or session storage.

2. **Request-Response Model**  
   HTTP operates on a request-response cycle:
   - **Client (usually a web browser):** Sends a request to a server.
   - **Server:** Processes the request and sends back a response containing the requested data or an error status.

3. **Text-Based Protocol**  
   HTTP messages are human-readable and consist of simple text, making it easy to understand and debug.

---

### **HTTP Versions**

1. **HTTP/0.9** (1991)
   - The first version of HTTP.
   - Supported only GET requests.
   - No support for headers or multimedia content.

2. **HTTP/1.0** (1996)
   - Introduced HTTP headers, status codes, and more request methods (e.g., POST, HEAD).

3. **HTTP/1.1** (1997)
   - Persistent connections (keep-alive) for multiple requests per connection.
   - Support for pipelining (sending multiple requests without waiting for responses).

4. **HTTP/2** (2015)
   - Binary framing for faster and more efficient communication.
   - Multiplexing allows multiple requests and responses to be sent simultaneously over a single connection.
   - Header compression for reducing bandwidth usage.

5. **HTTP/3** (2020)
   - Runs over QUIC instead of TCP, reducing latency.
   - Improved performance for mobile and real-time applications.

---

### **HTTP Request Structure**

An HTTP request contains:
1. **Request Line**
   - Method: The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   - URI: The resource being requested (e.g., `/index.html`).
   - HTTP Version: The version of HTTP (e.g., HTTP/1.1).

   Example:  
   `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`

2. **Headers**
   - Key-value pairs providing additional information about the request.  
     Example:  
     `Host: www.example.com`  
     `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0`

3. **Body** (optional)
   - Contains data sent to the server, often in POST or PUT requests.  
     Example: JSON payload, form data, etc.

---

### **HTTP Response Structure**

An HTTP response contains:
1. **Status Line**
   - HTTP Version: The version used in the response.
   - Status Code: Indicates the outcome of the request (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`).
   - Reason Phrase: Human-readable explanation of the status code.

   Example:  
   `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

2. **Headers**
   - Key-value pairs providing metadata about the response.  
     Example:  
     `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`  
     `Content-Length: 1024`

3. **Body** (optional)
   - Contains the content being sent back, such as HTML, JSON, or binary data.

---

### **Common HTTP Methods**

1. **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.  
2. **POST**: Send data to the server to create a resource.  
3. **PUT**: Update an existing resource or create if it doesn't exist.  
4. **DELETE**: Remove a resource.  
5. **HEAD**: Retrieve headers for a resource without the body.  
6. **OPTIONS**: Describe the communication options available.  
7. **PATCH**: Apply partial modifications to a resource.

---

### **HTTP Status Codes**

HTTP status codes are grouped into five categories:
1. **1xx Informational:** Request received, continuing process.  
   Example: `100 Continue`

2. **2xx Success:** The request was successfully received and processed.  
   Example: `200 OK`, `201 Created`

3. **3xx Redirection:** Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.  
   Example: `301 Moved Permanently`, `302 Found`

4. **4xx Client Error:** The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.  
   Example: `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`

5. **5xx Server Error:** The server failed to fulfill a valid request.  
   Example: `500 Internal Server Error`, `503 Service Unavailable`

---

### **How HTTP Works:**

1. **Connection Establishment**  
   - The client initiates a TCP (or QUIC in HTTP/3) connection with the server.

2. **Request Sending**  
   - The client sends an HTTP request over the established connection.

3. **Response Processing**  
   - The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.

4. **Connection Closure**  
   - The connection is closed or reused for subsequent requests.

---

### **Security in HTTP**

1. **HTTP vs. HTTPS**  
   - HTTP is not secure; data is transmitted in plaintext.  
   - HTTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure the data transfer.

2. **SSL/TLS**  
   - Encrypts communication to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.  
   - Ensures data integrity and authenticity.

---

### **Practical Applications**

1. **Web Browsing:** Accessing web pages.
2. **API Communication:** Backend services communicating via REST APIs.
3. **File Transfer:** Downloading or uploading files.

# HTTP Headers
### **HTTP Headers**

HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent with HTTP requests and responses to provide additional information about the communication. They define the parameters of the request or response, enabling a flexible and extensible mechanism to include metadata.

---

### **Categories of HTTP Headers**

HTTP headers can be broadly categorized as:

1. **General Headers:** Applicable to both requests and responses but not related to the actual data (e.g., caching policies).  
   Example: `Cache-Control`, `Date`

2. **Request Headers:** Provide information about the client making the request or details about what the client expects.  
   Example: `Host`, `User-Agent`

3. **Response Headers:** Provide additional information about the server response.  
   Example: `Server`, `Content-Type`

4. **Entity Headers:** Define metadata about the body content, such as content length or encoding.  
   Example: `Content-Length`, `Content-Encoding`

5. **Custom Headers:** Prefixed with `X-` or defined by developers for specific purposes.  
   Example: `X-Request-ID`

---

### **Common HTTP Headers**

#### **General Headers**
- `Cache-Control`: Specifies caching behavior.
  - Example: `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`

- `Date`: Indicates the date and time of the message.
  - Example: `Date: Tue, 12 Dec 2023 10:00:00 GMT`

#### **Request Headers**
- `Host`: Specifies the domain name and port number of the server.
  - Example: `Host: www.example.com`

- `User-Agent`: Identifies the client software making the request.
  - Example: `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)`

- `Accept`: Specifies the media types that the client can handle.
  - Example: `Accept: text/html, application/json`

- `Authorization`: Contains credentials for authenticating the client.
  - Example: `Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==`

- `Referer`: Provides the URL of the referring page.
  - Example: `Referer: https://www.google.com`

- `Content-Type`: Specifies the type of data being sent in the request body.
  - Example: `Content-Type: application/json`

- `Cookie`: Sends cookies stored by the client.
  - Example: `Cookie: sessionId=abc123`

#### **Response Headers**
- `Server`: Identifies the software used by the server.
  - Example: `Server: Apache/2.4.46`

- `Content-Type`: Specifies the media type of the resource in the response body.
  - Example: `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`

- `Content-Length`: Indicates the size of the response body in bytes.
  - Example: `Content-Length: 348`

- `Set-Cookie`: Sends cookies from the server to the client.
  - Example: `Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly`

- `ETag`: Provides a unique identifier for a version of the resource.
  - Example: `ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9"`

- `Location`: Used in redirection responses to specify the new URL.
  - Example: `Location: https://www.example.com/newpage`

#### **Entity Headers**
- `Content-Encoding`: Specifies the encoding used for the response body.
  - Example: `Content-Encoding: gzip`

- `Content-Language`: Indicates the language of the resource.
  - Example: `Content-Language: en-US`

- `Expires`: Specifies the expiration date of the resource.
  - Example: `Expires: Tue, 12 Dec 2023 10:00:00 GMT`

### **How to Use HTTP Headers in Code**

#### Example: Setting Response Headers in Node.js with Express

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.set({
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'
  });
  res.send({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

---

### **Header Best Practices**
1. **Use Standard Headers**: Follow HTTP standards for compatibility. Use headers like `Content-Type` and `Authorization` correctly.
2. **Secure Headers**:
   - Use `Strict-Transport-Security` to enforce HTTPS.
   - Add `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME type sniffing.
   - Add `Content-Security-Policy` to protect against XSS attacks.
3. **Avoid Overusing Custom Headers**: Only use custom headers when absolutely necessary.
