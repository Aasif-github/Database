### **AWS S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) – Explained**
  
**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is a **scalable, durable, and secure** object storage service provided by AWS. It allows you to store and retrieve **any amount of data** at **high availability and low latency**.

---

## **1️⃣ Key Features of AWS S3**
### 🔹 **1. Object Storage**
- Stores **objects (files, images, videos, backups, logs, etc.)**, not traditional file systems or block storage.
- Each object consists of:
  - **Key** (File Name)
  - **Value** (File Content)
  - **Metadata** (Information about the file)
  - **Version ID** (if versioning is enabled)

### 🔹 **2. Unlimited Storage Capacity**
- You can store **any amount of data**, from **kilobytes to petabytes**.

### 🔹 **3. High Durability & Availability**
- **Durability:** **99.999999999% (11 nines)** – your data is replicated across multiple AWS data centers.
- **Availability:** 99.99% uptime for Standard Storage.

### 🔹 **4. Multiple Storage Classes**
- **S3 Standard:** Frequently accessed data, low latency.
- **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access):** Lower cost, less frequent access.
- **S3 Glacier:** Long-term archival storage (cheapest but retrieval takes time).
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering:** Automatically moves data to cheaper storage classes based on access patterns.

### 🔹 **5. Security & Encryption**
- Supports **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)** & **Client-Side Encryption**.
- **Access Control** via **IAM policies, Bucket Policies, ACLs**.

### 🔹 **6. Data Versioning & Lifecycle Management**
- **Versioning**: Stores multiple versions of the same object.
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automatically move data to cheaper storage or delete old files.

### 🔹 **7. S3 Event Notifications**
- Triggers AWS services like **Lambda, SNS, SQS** when an object is uploaded, deleted, or modified.

### 🔹 **8. Static Website Hosting**
- You can host a **static website** using **S3** with **public access enabled**.

## **2️⃣ How AWS S3 Works?**
### **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket**
A **bucket** is like a **folder** where you store your files.

```sh
aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket-name
```

### **Step 2: Upload an Object**
Upload files (objects) into the S3 bucket.

```sh
aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://my-bucket-name/
```

### **Step 3: Download an Object**
Retrieve files from S3.

```sh
aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket-name/myfile.txt .
```

### **Step 4: List Objects in a Bucket**
```sh
aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket-name/
```

### **Step 5: Delete an Object**
```sh
aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket-name/myfile.txt
```

## **3️⃣ AWS S3 Use Cases**
✅ **Backup & Disaster Recovery** – Store backups safely.  
✅ **Big Data Analytics** – Data lake for analytics (e.g., AWS Athena, Redshift).  
✅ **Static Website Hosting** – Host HTML, CSS, JS files without servers.  
✅ **Media Storage & Streaming** – Store and serve images, videos, and logs.  
✅ **Machine Learning (ML) Data Storage** – Store training datasets.  

---

## **4️⃣ AWS S3 Pricing**
💰 **Pay-as-you-go** based on:
1️⃣ **Storage Used** (GB per month).  
2️⃣ **Requests & Data Retrieval** (PUT, GET, DELETE, LIST).  
3️⃣ **Data Transfer** (Free within AWS, but egress charges apply).  

👉 **Pricing varies by region**: [AWS S3 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)

## **5️⃣ AWS S3 vs. Other Storage**
| Feature            | AWS S3 (Object Storage) | EBS (Block Storage) | EFS (File Storage) |
|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Data Type**     | Objects (files, media) | Blocks (like HDD)  | Files & directories |
| **Access**        | URL-based             | Attached to EC2     | Shared across EC2  |
| **Scalability**   | Highly Scalable       | Fixed size per volume | Scales automatically |
| **Use Case**      | Backups, websites, data lakes | Databases, OS storage | Multi-instance file storage |

---

## **6️⃣ AWS S3 Integration with Lambda (Serverless)**
You can **trigger a Lambda function** when a file is uploaded or deleted.

### **Example S3 Event Triggering Lambda**
```yaml
Resources:
  MyS3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-lambda-bucket

  S3EventLambda:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      Handler: app.lambda_handler
      Runtime: python3.9
      Events:
        S3Event:
          Type: S3
          Properties:
            Bucket: !Ref MyS3Bucket
            Events: s3:ObjectCreated:*
```

---

## **7️⃣ Summary**
🔹 **AWS S3 is a scalable, durable, and cost-effective object storage service**.  
🔹 **Supports multiple storage classes for cost optimization**.  
🔹 **Highly secure with IAM roles, encryption, and bucket policies**.  
🔹 **Commonly used for backups, data lakes, media storage, and website hosting**.  
🔹 **Integrates with AWS Lambda, SNS, SQS, and other AWS services**.

# What is presigned url ?

### **📌 What is a Presigned URL in AWS S3?**  

A **Presigned URL** in **AWS S3** is a **temporary, secure URL** that allows a user to **upload or download** an object without requiring AWS credentials. It is commonly used when you want to grant **limited-time access** to an object in a private S3 bucket.

---

## **🚀 Why Use Presigned URLs?**
✅ **Secure Access** – Allows access **without exposing** AWS credentials.  
✅ **Time-limited** – The URL expires after a **set duration**.  
✅ **Fine-Grained Permissions** – Restrict to **specific operations** (upload/download).  
✅ **No Need for IAM Roles** – Useful for public users or external systems.  

---

## **🛠️ How a Presigned URL Works?**
1️⃣ **Generate a Presigned URL** using an IAM user or an AWS Lambda function.  
2️⃣ **Send the URL** to the client (user, web app, mobile app, etc.).  
3️⃣ **Client Uses the URL** to upload/download the object within the **expiration time**.  

---

## **🔹 Example 1: Generate a Presigned URL for Upload (PUT)**
This allows a user to upload a file to S3 **without needing AWS credentials**.

### **Node.js Example (AWS SDK v3)**
```javascript
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";

const s3 = new S3Client({ region: "us-east-1" });

async function generateUploadUrl() {
    const command = new PutObjectCommand({
        Bucket: "my-bucket-name",
        Key: "uploads/my-file.jpg",
        ContentType: "image/jpeg", // Optional: specify content type
    });

    const url = await getSignedUrl(s3, command, { expiresIn: 3600 }); // URL valid for 1 hour
    console.log("Upload URL:", url);
    return url;
}

generateUploadUrl();
```
**📌 How It Works?**
- Generates a **secure URL** for uploading `my-file.jpg` to `my-bucket-name/uploads/`.
- The **client uploads** directly using an HTTP `PUT` request to the URL.
- The URL **expires in 1 hour**.

---

## **🔹 Example 2: Generate a Presigned URL for Download (GET)**
This allows a user to **download a private file** securely.

### **Node.js Example (AWS SDK v3)**
```javascript
import { GetObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

async function generateDownloadUrl() {
    const command = new GetObjectCommand({
        Bucket: "my-bucket-name",
        Key: "uploads/my-file.jpg",
    });

    const url = await getSignedUrl(s3, command, { expiresIn: 3600 }); // URL valid for 1 hour
    console.log("Download URL:", url);
    return url;
}

generateDownloadUrl();
```
**📌 How It Works?**
- Generates a **secure URL** for downloading `my-file.jpg` from `my-bucket-name/uploads/`.
- The **client can use the URL** in a browser or app to download the file.
- The URL **expires after 1 hour**.

---

## **🔹 Presigned URL Use Cases**
✅ **Secure file uploads from users (without exposing S3 credentials)**.  
✅ **Allow temporary access to private files (e.g., invoices, reports, images)**.  
✅ **Restrict download access to authorized users only**.  
✅ **Generate temporary links for time-sensitive access**.  

---

## **🔹 Key Limitations**
🔸 **Only valid for a limited time** (default is **15 minutes to a few hours**).  
🔸 **Only allows specific actions (GET, PUT, DELETE)** based on permissions.  
🔸 **Generated by an IAM user or AWS Lambda** with the right **S3 permissions**.  

---

## **🔹 S3 Bucket Policy for Presigned URLs**
To allow users to upload using a **presigned URL**, your S3 bucket policy must allow `s3:PutObject`:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/uploads/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
This policy **only applies** when using a **presigned URL**.

---

## **✅ Summary**
🔹 **Presigned URLs** allow secure **temporary access** to S3 objects.  
🔹 Can be used for **uploads (PUT) or downloads (GET)**.  
🔹 **Generated via AWS SDK** (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.).  
🔹 **Time-limited** and only allows specific operations.  
🔹 Useful for **secure file sharing, user uploads, and temporary access**.
