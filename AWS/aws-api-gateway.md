## What is API Gateway?
An API gateway is a server that acts as an entry point for API calls. It receives requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate services. [1, 2]  
How does an API gateway work? [1, 3]  

‚Ä¢ It acts as a reverse proxy to accept API calls 
‚Ä¢ It aggregates the services needed to fulfill the request 
‚Ä¢ It returns the appropriate result 
‚Ä¢ It performs request processing based on defined policies 
‚Ä¢ It handles tasks like authentication, authorization, access control, SSL/TLS offloading, routing, and load balancing 

Why use an API gateway? [4, 5]  

‚Ä¢ It simplifies the management of the API ecosystem 
‚Ä¢ It makes it more efficient, secure, and easy to use 
‚Ä¢ It helps create a secure online shopping experience 

API gateway in microservices [2]  

‚Ä¢ In a microservices architecture, an API gateway acts as a centralized entry point for all clients into the system 

API gateway in Kubernetes [6]  

‚Ä¢ Gateway API is a family of API kinds that provide dynamic infrastructure provisioning and advanced traffic routing

## What is AWS API Gateway (HTTP API).
### **AWS API Gateway (HTTP API)**
AWS **API Gateway (HTTP API)** is a fully managed service that allows you to **create, manage, and secure APIs** for your applications. It enables you to expose AWS Lambda functions, backend services, or any HTTP-based endpoint as RESTful APIs with minimal configuration.

---

## **Key Features of HTTP API**
1. **Cost-Effective & Faster**  
   - Lower cost and reduced latency compared to API Gateway **REST API**.  
   - Ideal for simple, serverless applications using **AWS Lambda**.  

2. **Direct Integration with AWS Services**  
   - Easily connects with **AWS Lambda, Step Functions, DynamoDB, S3**, etc.  

3. **Built-in Authentication & Authorization**  
   - Supports **JWT authentication (Cognito, Okta, Auth0)**.  
   - Fine-grained access control using **IAM policies**.  

4. **Supports CORS**  
   - Allows cross-origin requests without additional configurations.  

5. **Automatic Scaling & High Availability**  
   - Fully managed service that scales based on demand.  

---

## **How HTTP API Works?**
1. **Client sends an HTTP request** to API Gateway.  
2. API Gateway **routes the request** to the configured AWS Lambda or backend service.  
3. Lambda executes business logic and **returns a response**.  
4. API Gateway sends the response back to the client.  

---

## **When to Use HTTP API vs. REST API?**
| Feature               | **HTTP API** (Recommended for Most Use Cases) | **REST API** (For Advanced Features) |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Latency & Cost**    | Lower cost, faster performance | Higher cost, more features |
| **Integration**       | AWS Lambda, HTTP Backends | AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Step Functions |
| **Authentication**    | JWT, IAM-based auth | JWT, IAM, Lambda Authorizers |
| **Rate Limiting**     | Basic throttling | Advanced rate limiting |
| **Caching**          | No built-in caching | Supports API Gateway Caching |
| **Use Case**         | Lightweight microservices & serverless apps | Full-featured API management |

---

## **Example: Deploying HTTP API with AWS Lambda**
1. **Create a simple Lambda function (Node.js)**
   ```javascript
   exports.handler = async (event) => {
       return {
           statusCode: 200,
           body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello from HTTP API!" }),
       };
   };
   ```
   
2. **Deploy API Gateway HTTP API in AWS Console**  
   - Create a new **HTTP API**.  
   - Add an **Integration** (AWS Lambda).  
   - Set up **routes & permissions**.  

3. **Test API Endpoint**  
   - Use **Postman** or `curl` to test:  
     ```sh
     curl https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com
     ```

---

## **Conclusion**
AWS API Gateway (HTTP API) is an **efficient, low-cost, and scalable** way to expose your AWS Lambda functions or backend services as APIs. It is recommended for **serverless applications, microservices, and lightweight APIs** that do not require advanced API Gateway REST API features. üöÄ

## How this is api-gateway?
### **How is AWS API Gateway an API Gateway?**  

An **API Gateway** is a **reverse proxy** that sits between clients and backend services, handling request routing, authentication, and response transformation. AWS **API Gateway** follows this concept by acting as an entry point for applications, managing API requests, and securely exposing backend services.

---

## **How AWS API Gateway Works as an API Gateway?**  

### **1. Centralized Request Handling**  
- AWS **API Gateway** receives incoming HTTP requests.  
- It **routes** the request to the appropriate **AWS Lambda function, EC2, or backend API**.  
- It processes the response and sends it back to the client.  

**Example:**  
üîó Client ‚Üí üåç API Gateway ‚Üí ‚ö° AWS Lambda / Backend ‚Üí üèÅ Response  

---

### **2. Authentication & Security**  
- Supports **JWT, IAM roles, Lambda Authorizers** for access control.  
- Can **validate and authorize requests** before forwarding them.  
- Provides **rate limiting** and **throttling** to prevent abuse.  

---

### **3. Request Transformation & Response Processing**  
- Can modify request/response payloads without changing backend logic.  
- Supports **mapping templates** for customizing API responses.  

---

### **4. Protocol Translation & Integration**  
- Converts **HTTP requests** to different formats (e.g., REST, WebSocket).  
- Directly integrates with AWS services like **Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, SNS**.  
- Can route to **external HTTP services** (like microservices or third-party APIs).  

---

### **5. High Availability & Scalability**  
- Fully managed service with **automatic scaling**.  
- Handles **thousands to millions** of requests per second.  
- Provides **caching** for improved performance (REST API only).  

---

## **Comparison: API Gateway vs. Traditional Backend**  
| **Feature**        | **API Gateway**  | **Direct Backend (No API Gateway)**  |
|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Request Routing** | Handles routing & traffic distribution | Manual request handling |
| **Authentication** | Built-in IAM, JWT, OAuth | Requires custom implementation |
| **Rate Limiting** | Automatic throttling & quotas | Needs separate rate-limiting logic |
| **Scalability** | Auto-scales with demand | Manual scaling required |
| **Security** | Managed security controls | Custom security implementation |

---

## **Example Use Case: API Gateway with AWS Lambda**  
1. **Client sends an HTTP request** to the API Gateway endpoint.  
2. API Gateway **validates the request** (authentication, rate limits).  
3. The request is **forwarded to AWS Lambda**.  
4. Lambda executes logic and **returns a response**.  
5. API Gateway **formats the response** and sends it back to the client.  

üìå **Without API Gateway:**  
   - Each microservice would need its own authentication, routing, and scaling setup.  
   - No centralized control over security and monitoring.  

üìå **With API Gateway:**  
   - API requests are **securely managed, authenticated, and optimized**.  
   - Backend services remain **decoupled and scalable**.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
AWS **API Gateway** is a true **API Gateway** because it:  
‚úÖ **Acts as a single entry point** for client requests.  
‚úÖ **Handles authentication, request transformation, and routing**.  
‚úÖ **Connects multiple backend services (Lambda, EC2, external APIs)**.  
‚úÖ **Provides scalability, security, and monitoring** for API traffic.  

üöÄ **It simplifies API management and is essential for modern serverless & microservices architectures!**
