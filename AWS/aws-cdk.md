AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source framework that lets you define and provision cloud infrastructure using programming languages like Python, Java, and TypeScript. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
How does AWS CDK work? [3, 4]  

1. You use programming languages to define cloud infrastructure as code. [3, 4]  
2. AWS CloudFormation provisions the cloud infrastructure in a safe and repeatable way. [2, 3]  

Benefits of AWS CDK [2, 5]  

• You can use your existing Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and testing tools. [2, 5]  
• You can apply the same best practices used in software development. [4]  
• You can create and manage AWS resources more efficiently. [1]  
• You can create complex architectures for deployment in AWS. [2]  

Components of AWS CDK [6]  

• CDK apps: The top-level component of your CDK project that contains all stacks 
• CDK stacks: Correspond to CloudFormation stacks 
• CDK constructs: Represent your resources in CDK stacks 

AWS CDK resources [7]  
You can find, publish, and share open-source AWS CDK libraries using Construct Hub. [7]  
CDK Toolkit [8]  
The AWS CDK Command Line Interface (AWS CDK CLI), also known as the CDK Toolkit, is the primary tool for interacting with your AWS CDK app. [8]
