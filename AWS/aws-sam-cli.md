# **Why Use AWS SAM CLI?**  

AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) CLI is used to **simplify the development, testing, and deployment** of serverless applications. It provides a framework for managing AWS Lambda functions along with other AWS services like API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3.

---

## **🔹 Key Benefits of Using AWS SAM CLI**  

### **1️⃣ Easier Deployment of Serverless Applications**  
✅ **Simplifies deployment** – No need to manually set up Lambda, API Gateway, or IAM roles.  
✅ **One-click deploy** – Just run `sam deploy --guided`.  

🔹 **Example:**  
Instead of using the AWS Console or complex `aws-cli` commands, you define everything in `template.yaml` and deploy easily.  

---

### **2️⃣ Local Testing and Debugging** 🛠  
✅ **Run Lambda functions locally** before deploying.  
✅ **Test API Gateway and DynamoDB locally**.  

🔹 **Example:**  
You can test a Lambda function **locally** without deploying:  
```sh
sam local invoke MyLambdaFunction
```
or run an **API Gateway locally**:  
```sh
sam local start-api
```

---

### **3️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with YAML**  
✅ **Defines infrastructure in a single file (`template.yaml`)**.  
✅ **Easier to version-control with Git**.  
✅ **Reusable templates** for multiple environments (dev, prod).  

🔹 **Example (`template.yaml`)**:  
```yaml
Resources:
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      Runtime: nodejs18.x
      Handler: app.lambdaHandler
      MemorySize: 128
      Timeout: 5
```

Instead of manually creating resources in AWS, this single YAML file defines everything.

---

### **4️⃣ Faster Development with `sam build`** 🚀  
✅ **Automatically packages and prepares Lambda functions**.  
✅ **Builds dependencies for different runtimes (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)**.  

🔹 **Example:**  
Run the following to build your project before deployment:  
```sh
sam build
```

---

### **5️⃣ Simplifies Deployment with `sam deploy`**  
✅ **Automates deployment** instead of using manual AWS Console setup.  
✅ **Supports CloudFormation stacks for easy rollback and updates**.  

🔹 **Example:**  
```sh
sam deploy --guided
```
This:
- Packages and uploads code to S3.
- Creates or updates Lambda, API Gateway, IAM roles.
- Deploys the stack in minutes.

---

### **6️⃣ Supports CI/CD Integration**  
✅ **Can be used with GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, and Jenkins**.  
✅ **Automates deployments with minimal manual effort**.  

🔹 **Example CI/CD Workflow:**  
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Deploy Lambda with AWS SAM
        run: |
          sam build
          sam deploy --no-confirm-changeset
```

---

### **7️⃣ Cost Optimization** 💰  
✅ **Avoids unnecessary Lambda executions in AWS** (since you can test locally).  
✅ **Only deploys what has changed** instead of redeploying the entire app.
