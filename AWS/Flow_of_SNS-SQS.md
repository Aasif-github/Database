# Explain me the flow of sending sms using aws sns and sqs.

### **Flow of Sending SMS Using AWS SNS and SQS**  

Amazon **SNS (Simple Notification Service)** and **SQS (Simple Queue Service)** work together to ensure reliable and scalable message delivery for sending SMS notifications asynchronously.  

---

### **Flow Diagram Overview**  
1. **User/Service Publishes a Message to SNS**  
2. **SNS Distributes the Message**  
   - If sending SMS directly ‚Üí SNS sends it to the recipient.  
   - If using SQS ‚Üí SNS sends the message to an SQS queue for further processing.  
3. **Consumer (Worker) Reads from SQS**  
4. **Consumer Sends SMS via AWS SNS API**  

---

### **Step-by-Step Flow**  

#### **1. Create an SNS Topic**  
- SNS acts as a pub/sub messaging system.
- It can directly send SMS or forward messages to SQS.

#### **2. Subscribe SQS to the SNS Topic**  
- Messages published to SNS are delivered to the SQS queue.
- SQS ensures reliable and scalable message storage.

#### **3. Publish a Message to SNS**  
- An application (e.g., Node.js backend) publishes a message (SMS payload) to SNS.

#### **4. SQS Stores the Message**  
- If direct SMS is not required, SNS routes the message to an SQS queue.
- This ensures that messages are not lost if SMS delivery fails.

#### **5. Consumer Reads from SQS**  
- A worker service (Lambda, EC2, or a Node.js script) polls the SQS queue.
- It retrieves the SMS message.

#### **6. Consumer Sends SMS via SNS**  
- The worker extracts the phone number and message from the SQS message.
- It uses **AWS SNS API** to send the SMS to the recipient.

#### **7. Message is Delivered to the User**  
- AWS SNS routes the SMS via mobile carriers.
- The recipient receives the SMS.

### **Flow Representation**  

1. **App ‚Üí SNS ‚Üí SMS (Direct SMS Delivery)**
   - _Best when real-time SMS is needed._
   - Example: OTP messages.

2. **App ‚Üí SNS ‚Üí SQS ‚Üí Worker ‚Üí SNS ‚Üí SMS**
   - _Best for handling retries, queuing, and delayed processing._
   - Example: Bulk SMS campaigns.

### **Use Case Scenarios**  

| Use Case            | Direct SNS to SMS | SNS + SQS + Worker |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| OTP Verification   | ‚úÖ Yes          | ‚ùå No (Not needed) |
| Bulk SMS Campaigns | ‚ùå No           | ‚úÖ Yes (For queuing) |
| Asynchronous Messaging | ‚ùå No       | ‚úÖ Yes (Ensures message reliability) |

# Explain me this- 
```js
//email queue(AWS-SQS)
    const emailQueue = new Queue(this, 'email_queue', {
      visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(180), //timeout of processing a single message
    });
```    

### **Explanation of the Email Queue (AWS SQS) Code**
This code defines an **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) queue** for handling emails in an AWS **CDK (Cloud Development Kit)** application.

---

### **Breakdown of the Code**
```javascript
// Create an email queue (AWS SQS)
const emailQueue = new Queue(this, 'email_queue', {
  visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(180), // Timeout for message processing
});
```

#### **1. `new Queue(this, 'email_queue', {...})`**
- Creates a new **SQS queue** named `"email_queue"`.  
- This queue is used to **temporarily store email processing tasks**.  
- It ensures **asynchronous email sending**, which improves scalability.

#### **2. `visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(180)`**
- The **visibility timeout** defines how long a message is **hidden** from other consumers after being picked up.
- It prevents multiple workers from processing the same message simultaneously.
- If a worker picks up a message but doesn't delete it within **180 seconds (3 minutes)**, the message becomes visible again for another worker to process.
- This is useful when an email sending process **takes longer and needs retries**.

---

### **Flow of Email Processing with SQS**
1. **Producer (Application) Sends an Email Request**
   - A user requests an email to be sent.
   - The request is added as a message to the `email_queue`.

2. **Worker (Lambda/EC2) Polls the Queue**
   - A worker reads the message and starts sending the email.
   - The message is **hidden** from other workers for `180` seconds (`visibilityTimeout`).

3. **Email Sending Completion**
   - If successful, the worker **deletes** the message from SQS.
   - If it **fails** (e.g., email service is down), the message becomes visible again after `180` seconds for another retry.

---

### **Why Use SQS for Email Processing?**
‚úÖ **Ensures Reliable Delivery** ‚Äì If a worker fails, another can process it.  
‚úÖ **Decouples Services** ‚Äì Email sending doesn't block the main app.  
‚úÖ **Handles Failures Gracefully** ‚Äì Retries if the process fails.
