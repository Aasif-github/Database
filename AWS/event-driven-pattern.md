## Event-Driven Architecture
Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern that enables systems to detect and respond to events in real time.

How it works
1. Events are detected, such as a transaction or website visit 
2. Information about the event is sent to relevant apps, systems, and people 
3. Systems react to the event in real time or near real time 


Benefits of EDA

- Scalability: Applications can scale up and down based on need 
- Interoperability: Loosely coupled layers enable access to large amounts of data 
- Asynchronicity: Events can trigger services without blocking other services 
- Auditing: Events can be logged and audited for quality assurance 
- Reduced operational costs: Network bandwidth consumption, CPU utilization, and encryption are lower than traditional models 
  

Real-world examples
- EDA is used in many applications, including: Fraud detection, Internet of Things (IoT), Payment processing, Real-time marketing, and Website monitoring.
