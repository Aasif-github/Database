# Topics in Pub-Sub

In a **Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) model**, a **topic** is a logical channel or category to which messages are published and from which subscribers receive messages. It acts as a central hub that enables multiple publishers to send messages and multiple subscribers to consume those messages without knowing each other.

### ðŸ”¹ **Key Concepts of a Topic in Pub-Sub:**
1. **Publisher:** The sender that publishes messages to a topic.
2. **Subscriber:** The receiver that subscribes to a topic to get messages.
3. **Topic:** A logical channel where messages are sent and from which subscribers receive messages.
4. **Message:** The actual data or event published to a topic.
5. **Broker:** A message broker (like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SNS) that manages topics and message delivery.

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
1. A **publisher** sends a message to a **topic**.
2. The **topic** forwards the message to all **subscribers**.
3. Each **subscriber** receives a copy of the message independently.

### ðŸ”¹ **Example Use Case:**
- A **stock price update system**:
  - A stock market app publishes updates on **Stock Price Updates** topic.
  - Multiple subscribers (e.g., mobile apps, trading platforms) receive real-time stock updates.

### ðŸ”¹ **Examples in Technologies:**
- **Apache Kafka:** Topics store streams of records.
- **RabbitMQ:** Uses topics in exchanges for routing.
- **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service):** Uses topics to send notifications to multiple subscribers.

 
# What are publisher and subscriber here.

 ### **Publisher and Subscriber in Pub-Sub Model**  

In a **Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) model**, **publishers** and **subscribers** play distinct roles:

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Publisher**  
A **publisher** is a producer that sends messages (events) to a **topic** without directly sending them to any specific subscriber.  

#### âœ… **Characteristics of a Publisher:**
- Generates and sends messages (events) to a topic.
- Does **not** know who the subscribers are.
- Works asynchronously.
- Can be multiple publishers for the same topic.

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Example Use Case:**
- A **weather monitoring system** publishes temperature updates every second to a **Weather Updates** topic.

#### **Example in Kafka (Node.js)**
```javascript
const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');

const kafka = new Kafka({ clientId: 'my-app', brokers: ['localhost:9092'] });
const producer = kafka.producer();

const run = async () => {
    await producer.connect();
    await producer.send({
        topic: 'weather-updates',
        messages: [{ value: JSON.stringify({ temperature: 30, city: 'Delhi' }) }],
    });
    console.log('Message sent!');
    await producer.disconnect();
};

run();
```

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Subscriber**  
A **subscriber** is a consumer that listens for messages from a **topic** and processes them.

#### âœ… **Characteristics of a Subscriber:**
- Subscribes to a **topic** to receive messages.
- Processes messages asynchronously.
- Can be multiple subscribers for the same topic.
- Each subscriber receives a copy of the message.

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Example Use Case:**
- A **mobile app** subscribes to the **Weather Updates** topic to display real-time temperature updates.

#### **Example in Kafka (Node.js)**
```javascript
const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'weather-consumers' });

const run = async () => {
    await consumer.connect();
    await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'weather-updates', fromBeginning: true });

    await consumer.run({
        eachMessage: async ({ message }) => {
            console.log(`Received: ${message.value.toString()}`);
        },
    });
};

run();
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Summary**
| **Component**  | **Description**  | **Example**  |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Publisher**  | Sends messages to a topic | Weather system sending temperature updates |
| **Topic**  | Central hub for messages | `weather-updates` |
| **Subscriber**  | Listens for messages from a topic | Mobile app displaying temperature |
