## CQRS

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a software design pattern that separates read and write operations in an application. This separation allows for independent optimization of each model, which can improve performance, scalability, and security. [1, 2]  
How does CQRS work? [3]  

• Splits an application into two parts: the command side and the query side [3]  
• The command side handles create, update, and delete requests [3]  
• The query side runs queries using read replicas [3]  
• Allows for different database types to be used for reading and writing [4]  

When is CQRS used? [2]  

• CQRS is often used in mission-critical systems where performance and scalability are essential [2]  
• It can also be used to separate updates and queries that have different requirements for throughput, latency, or consistency [3]  

CQRS design considerations: Database separation, Event-driven synchronization, Materialized views, and Technology stack. [5]  
Challenges with CQRS: [6]  

• Supporting event structure version management 
• How much data to keep in the event store 
• How to adopt data duplication
