### 1. **What are migrations in Laravel?**
Migrations in Laravel are a version control system for database schemas. They allow you to define and modify database tables and columns using PHP code, making it easy to create, update, or rollback database structures. Migrations are stored in the `database/migrations` directory and executed via Artisan commands.
- **Example**:
  ```php
  Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
      $table->id();
      $table->string('name');
      $table->timestamps();
  });
  ```
- **Commands**:
  - `php artisan make:migration create_users_table`: Creates a migration file.
  - `php artisan migrate`: Runs migrations.
  - `php artisan migrate:rollback`: Reverts the last migration.

### 2. **What is the latest Laravel version?**
As of May 7, 2025, the latest stable version of Laravel is **Laravel 11**, released in March 2024. Always check the official Laravel website (https://laravel.com) or GitHub repository for the most recent updates.

---

### 3. **What are Models?**
Models in Laravel represent database tables and are used to interact with data using Eloquent ORM. A model class typically corresponds to a single database table, and it provides methods to query, insert, update, or delete records. Models also handle relationships (e.g., one-to-many).
- **Example**:
  ```php
  namespace App\Models;
  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

  class User extends Model {
      protected $fillable = ['name', 'email'];
  }
  ```
- **Usage**:
  ```php
  $user = User::create(['name' => 'John', 'email' => 'john@example.com']);
  ```

---

### 4. **How to implement soft delete in Laravel?**
Soft delete allows records to be marked as deleted without removing them from the database, using a `deleted_at` timestamp.
- **Steps**:
  1. Add the `SoftDeletes` trait to your model:
     ```php
     namespace App\Models;
     use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
     use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;

     class Post extends Model {
         use SoftDeletes;
         protected $fillable = ['title', 'content'];
     }
     ```
  2. Add the `deleted_at` column to the table via a migration:
     ```php
     Schema::create('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
         $table->id();
         $table->string('title');
         $table->text('content');
         $table->softDeletes(); // Adds deleted_at column
         $table->timestamps();
     });
     ```
  3. Use soft delete methods:
     - Delete: `$post->delete();` (sets `deleted_at` timestamp).
     - Restore: `$post->restore();`.
     - Query with soft-deleted records: `Post::withTrashed()->get();`.
     - Permanently delete: `$post->forceDelete();`.

### 5. **What are factories in Laravel?**
Factories in Laravel are used to generate fake data for testing or seeding databases. They define how to create model instances with realistic dummy data using the Faker library.
- **Example**:
  ```php
  namespace Database\Factories;
  use App\Models\User;
  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\Factory;

  class UserFactory extends Factory {
      protected $model = User::class;
      public function definition() {
          return [
              'name' => $this->faker->name,
              'email' => $this->faker->unique()->safeEmail,
              'password' => bcrypt('password'),
          ];
      }
  }
  ```
- **Usage**:
  ```php
  $user = User::factory()->create(); // Creates one user
  User::factory(10)->create(); // Creates 10 users
  ```

---

### 6. **What are seeders in Laravel?**
Seeders are classes that populate the database with initial or test data. They are stored in `database/seeders` and executed via Artisan commands.
- **Example**:
  ```php
  namespace Database\Seeders;
  use App\Models\User;
  use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;

  class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder {
      public function run() {
          User::factory(10)->create();
      }
  }
  ```
- **Commands**:
  - `php artisan make:seeder UserSeeder`: Creates a seeder.
  - `php artisan db:seed`: Runs the `DatabaseSeeder`.
  - `php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder`: Runs a specific seeder.

---

### 7. **What are the default route files in Laravel?**
Laravel’s default route files define how HTTP requests are handled. They are located in the `routes` directory:
- **web.php**: Handles web routes with session state and CSRF protection (e.g., for browser-based apps).
  ```php
  Route::get('/', [HomeController::class, 'index']);
  ```
- **api.php**: Handles stateless API routes, typically with JSON responses and API middleware.
  ```php
  Route::get('/users', [UserController::class, 'index']);
  ```
- **console.php**: Defines Artisan console commands.
- **channels.php**: Defines WebSocket event broadcasting channels.

---

### 8. **How to put Laravel applications in maintenance mode?**
Maintenance mode allows you to temporarily disable access to your application, displaying a maintenance page.
- **Enable Maintenance Mode**:
  ```bash
  php artisan down
  ```
  - Creates a `storage/framework/maintenance.php` file.
  - Optionally, customize the response:
    ```bash
    php artisan down --secret="my-secret" --render="errors::503"
    ```
    - `--secret` allows bypassing maintenance mode via `/my-secret`.
    - `--render` specifies a custom view.
- **Disable Maintenance Mode**:
  ```bash
  php artisan up
  ```
- **Customizing the Maintenance Page**: Edit the `resources/views/errors/503.blade.php` template.

### 9. **Can we use Laravel for Full Stack Development (Frontend + Backend)?**
Yes, Laravel is suitable for full-stack development:
- **Backend**: Laravel handles APIs, database interactions, authentication, and business logic using Eloquent, controllers, and middleware.
- **Frontend**:
  - **Blade**: Laravel’s templating engine for server-side rendering.
  - **Laravel Livewire**: Enables reactive, component-based frontends without heavy JavaScript.
  - **Inertia.js**: Integrates Laravel with modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., Vue, React) for single-page applications (SPAs).
  - **API + Frontend Frameworks**: Build APIs with Laravel and pair with Vue, React, or Angular for the frontend.
- **Tools**: Laravel Breeze and Jetstream provide starter kits for authentication and frontend scaffolding.
- **Example**: Use Laravel for the backend API and Vue with Inertia.js for a seamless full-stack experience.

### 10. **How to define environment variables in Laravel?**
Environment variables are defined in the `.env` file at the project root, allowing configuration without hardcoding sensitive data.
- **Example**:
  ```env
  APP_NAME=MyApp
  DB_CONNECTION=mysql
  DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
  DB_PORT=3306
  DB_DATABASE=myapp
  DB_USERNAME=root
  DB_PASSWORD=secret
  ```
- **Accessing Variables**:
  - Use the `env()` helper or configuration files:
    ```php
    $dbHost = env('DB_HOST', 'default_value');
    ```
  - Or via config files (e.g., `config/database.php`):
    ```php
    'mysql' => [
        'host' => env('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
    ],
    ```
- **Best Practices**:
  - Cache config in production: `php artisan config:cache`.
  - Never commit `.env` to version control; use `.env.example` for templates.

---

### 11. **What is an Artisan?**
Artisan is Laravel’s command-line interface (CLI) for running tasks, generating boilerplate code, and managing the application. It provides built-in and custom commands to streamline development.
- **Examples**:
  - `php artisan make:model User`: Creates a model.
  - `php artisan migrate`: Runs database migrations.
  - `php artisan serve`: Starts a local development server.
- **Custom Commands**: Create custom Artisan commands in `app/Console/Commands`.
- **List Commands**: `php artisan list` shows all available commands.

---

### 12. **What are the available databases supported by Laravel?**
Laravel supports multiple database systems via its database abstraction layer and Eloquent ORM:
- **MySQL** (default)
- **PostgreSQL**
- **SQLite** (lightweight, file-based)
- **SQL Server**
- **MariaDB** (MySQL-compatible)
- **Configuration**: Set the `DB_CONNECTION` in `.env`:
  ```env
  DB_CONNECTION=mysql
  ```
- **Custom Drivers**: Laravel supports custom database drivers via community packages or manual configuration.

---

### 13. **What is the templating engine used in Laravel?**
Laravel uses **Blade** as its templating engine. Blade allows developers to create dynamic, reusable views with minimal syntax, supporting layouts, components, and directives.
- **Example**:
  ```blade
  @extends('layouts.app')
  @section('content')
      <h1>Hello, {{ $name }}</h1>
      @foreach ($users as $user)
          <p>{{ $user->name }}</p>
      @endforeach
  @endsection
  ```
- **Features**: Template inheritance, conditionals, loops, and reusable components.

---

### 14. **Define Composer.**
Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP, used in Laravel to manage libraries, packages, and autoloading. It resolves and installs dependencies defined in `composer.json` and generates an autoloader.
- **Key Files**:
  - `composer.json`: Lists project dependencies and metadata.
  - `composer.lock`: Locks specific versions of dependencies.
- **Common Commands**:
  - `composer install`: Installs dependencies.
  - `composer update`: Updates dependencies.
  - `composer require vendor/package`: Adds a new package.
- **Laravel Usage**: Laravel’s core and third-party packages (e.g., Laravel Sanctum) are managed via Composer.
  ```bash
  composer require laravel/sanctum
  ```
