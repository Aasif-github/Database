In your provided code snippet, the `for` loop executes **immediately** after the `console.log('start')` because the `Promise` constructor executes synchronously.

### Explanation of Code Execution

```javascript
console.log('start'); // Line 1

let task1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { // Line 3
    // Synchronous block
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        console.log('i', i); // Runs immediately during promise creation
    }

    resolve('done'); // The resolve function is called after the loop finishes
});

task1
  .then((value) => console.log(value)) // Runs after the promise is resolved
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));   // Handles any promise rejection

console.log('end'); // Line 12
```

### Why the `for` Loop Runs Immediately

- **Promises Are Synchronous at Creation**:
  - When a `Promise` object is created, the code inside the `Promise` constructor (the callback provided to `new Promise`) is executed immediately.
  - In this case, the `for` loop runs inside the synchronous portion of the promise, so it starts executing right after the `console.log('start')`.

- **Asynchronous Behavior of `then`**:
  - The `then` and `catch` handlers are registered **asynchronously** using the JavaScript event loop.
  - These handlers only execute **after the synchronous code finishes** and the current call stack is cleared.

### Step-by-Step Execution
1. **Line 1 (`console.log('start')`)**: Prints `start`.
2. **Line 3 (Promise constructor)**: The `Promise` object is created, and the code inside its constructor is executed synchronously.
3. **Line 5 (`for` loop)**: Executes immediately, printing `i` values from `0` to `999`.
4. **Line 9 (`resolve('done')`)**: Resolves the promise after the loop is done.
5. **Line 12 (`console.log('end')`)**: Prints `end` synchronously.
6. **Promise `.then` Handler**: Once the main script is done, the promise resolution triggers the `.then` handler asynchronously, printing `done`.

### Output
```
start
i 0
i 1
i 2
...
i 999
end
done
```

### Key Takeaways
- Code inside the `Promise` constructor runs **synchronously**.
- Code in `.then` or `.catch` executes **asynchronously**, after the current synchronous tasks are completed.
- The `for` loop runs synchronously as part of the promise creation.



### To show How Promise is work asynchronous, we have to pass the result in resolve and reject function.
```js
console.log('start');

console.log('1');

let task1 = new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{

let sum = 0;
    for(let i=0; i<1000; i++){
      sum += i
    }
 
  
  resolve(sum);
})

console.log('2');

console.log('3');

task1
  .then((value)=>console.log('Sum:',value))
  .catch((err)=>console.log(err));

console.log('end')

```

output:
```
start
1
2
3
end
Sum: 499500
```
