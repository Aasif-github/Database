**JavaScript (JS)** is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, multi-paradigm programming language that conforms to the **ECMAScript** specification. It is interpreted and executed in a browser or runtime environment (like Node.js) to enable interactive and asynchronous web functionalities.

### Technical Features:
1. **Event-Driven and Non-Blocking**: Uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread.
2. **Prototype-Based Object Orientation**: Implements inheritance and object manipulation using prototypes rather than classes (though ES6 introduced `class` syntax as syntactic sugar).
3. **Dynamically Typed**: Variable types are determined at runtime.
4. **JIT Compilation**: Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers to improve execution speed.
5. **Garbage-Collected**: Automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation.

### Usage Contexts:
- **Client-Side**: Manipulating the DOM, handling user events, and animating web pages.
- **Server-Side**: Powering scalable server applications with frameworks like Express.js on Node.js.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Building apps with frameworks like React Native or Electron.
