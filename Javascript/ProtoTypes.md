# ProtoTypes

## JavaScript Prototypes

In JavaScript, a **prototype** is an object that serves as a blueprint for other objects. 

It allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, enabling reusability and efficient memory usage.

---

### **Key Points About Prototypes**
1. **Every Object Has a Prototype**
   - When you create an object, it has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]` that refers to another object (its prototype).
   - In JavaScript, the prototype chain determines how properties and methods are resolved when accessed on an object.

2. **Prototype Chain**
   - If a property or method is not found directly on the object, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype.
   - This continues up the chain until the property/method is found or the chain ends with `null`.

---

### **Examples**

### Key Points:
1. Every JavaScript object has an internal link to another object called its **prototype**. This is accessible via the `__proto__` property (deprecated but still available for learning purposes) or through `Object.getPrototypeOf()`.

2. Functions in JavaScript also have a `prototype` property, which is used when creating new objects with the `new` keyword.

3. Methods and properties defined on an object's prototype are shared among all objects that inherit from it.

### Example: Prototypes in Action

```javascript
// Step 1: Create a constructor function
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name; // Instance property
    this.age = age;   // Instance property
}

// Step 2: Add a method to the prototype
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
};

// Step 3: Create instances
const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
const person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

// Both instances can access the prototype method
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
person2.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.

// Step 4: Check the prototype chain
console.log(person1.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(person1) === Person.prototype); // true
```

### Explanation:
1. **`Person.prototype`**:
   - This is an object that is automatically created when a function is declared.
   - It serves as a blueprint for objects created using the `new` keyword.
   
2. **Shared Methods**:
   - The `greet` method is added to `Person.prototype`. This method is shared by all instances of `Person`, saving memory as it is not duplicated for each instance.

3. **Prototype Chain**:
   - When you call `person1.greet()`, JavaScript first looks for the `greet` method in `person1`. If not found, it searches in `person1.__proto__` (or `Person.prototype`).

### Extending Prototypes:
You can also extend built-in prototypes like `Array` or `Object`. However, **this practice is discouraged**, as it can lead to unexpected behavior if other code relies on the unaltered prototype.

```javascript
Array.prototype.sum = function() {
    return this.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
};

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(numbers.sum()); // Output: 10
```

### Summary:
- Prototypes are the foundation of inheritance in JavaScript.
- They allow objects to share behaviors and properties efficiently.
- Use `Object.create` or constructor functions with prototypes for prototypal inheritance. 

Let me know if you'd like to explore **ES6 classes**, which are a more modern way to use prototypes in JavaScript.
### **Benefits of Using Prototypes**
1. **Memory Efficiency**: Methods shared across objects do not need to be recreated for every instance.
2. **Inheritance**: Enables sharing and extending functionality between objects.
3. **Dynamic Addition**: You can add methods or properties to prototypes even after objects are created.

### **Prototype vs `__proto__` vs `prototype`**
Understanding the differences between `prototype`, `__proto__`, and `Prototype` in JavaScript can be confusing at first. Let’s break it down:

---

### **1. `prototype`**
- A **property** of constructor functions.
- Used to define methods and properties that should be shared among all instances of objects created by the constructor.
- Objects created by the constructor function inherit from the `prototype`.

#### Example:
```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
};

const person1 = new Person("Alice");
const person2 = new Person("Bob");

// The `greet` method is shared via the `prototype`.
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice.
person2.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Bob.
```

- **Key Points**:
  - The `prototype` is used as a blueprint for instances created using the constructor function.
  - When a property or method is not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks for it in the `prototype`.

---

### **2. `__proto__`**
- A **property of all objects** that points to the prototype of the object’s constructor.
- This is how JavaScript implements the **prototype chain**.
- **Deprecated** but still widely used for learning purposes and debugging. The modern equivalent is `Object.getPrototypeOf()`.

#### Example:
```javascript
const person = { name: "Alice" };
console.log(person.__proto__); // Points to Object.prototype
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(person)); // Preferred way to access prototype
```

- **Key Points**:
  - `__proto__` links an object to its prototype (i.e., `Person.prototype` in the previous example).
  - Used to traverse the prototype chain.

#### Example of Prototype Chain:
```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
};

const person = new Person("Alice");

console.log(person.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true
console.log(Person.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
console.log(Object.prototype.__proto__ === null); // true (end of chain)
```

---

### **3. `Prototype` (as a concept)**
- Refers to the **mechanism of inheritance** in JavaScript.
- Allows objects to share properties and methods via a "prototype chain."

### **Comparison Table**

| Feature          | `prototype`                     | `__proto__`                      | Concept of Prototype            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **What is it?**   | A property of constructor functions. | A property of all objects pointing to their prototype. | The overall mechanism of inheritance in JavaScript. |
| **Purpose**       | Defines shared methods and properties. | Enables access to the prototype chain. | Allows objects to inherit behavior. |
| **Type**          | Object                          | Object                            | Concept                          |
| **Usage**         | Used for inheritance and method sharing in constructors. | Debugging and accessing prototype objects. | The foundation of JavaScript's inheritance. |
| **Modern Usage**  | Actively used.                  | Avoided (use `Object.getPrototypeOf()`). | Always relevant.                |

### **How They Work Together**

1. **`prototype`**:
   - When a constructor function (e.g., `Person`) is created, it has a `prototype` property.
   - This `prototype` becomes the prototype for all objects created by the constructor.

2. **`__proto__`**:
   - When you create an object using `new`, the object's `__proto__` points to the constructor's `prototype`.

3. **Prototype Chain**:
   - When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript searches:
     - The object itself.
     - The object's `__proto__` (constructor's `prototype`).
     - The prototype chain continues until `null`.

---

### Visual Example

```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
};

const person = new Person("Alice");

// person.__proto__ points to Person.prototype
console.log(person.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true

// Person.prototype.__proto__ points to Object.prototype
console.log(Person.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true

// Object.prototype.__proto__ is null
console.log(Object.prototype.__proto__ === null); // true
```

---

### Summary:
- Use **`prototype`** for defining shared properties and methods in constructor functions.
- Avoid **`__proto__`**; instead, use `Object.getPrototypeOf()` for accessing the prototype chain.
- Understand the **prototype chain** to debug inheritance and method resolution issues effectively.

Let me know if you'd like examples on **Object.create()**, how to modify prototypes dynamically, or other related topics!

---

### **Common Misunderstandings**
- Prototypes do not copy methods or properties; objects reference them through the prototype chain.
- `class` is just a cleaner way to work with prototypes, not a separate system.
