### Higher Order Function?

- A higher-order function is a function that accepts a function as an argument 
- or returns a function as a result.

Higher-order functions are useful because they allow you to compose functions together to create more complex functions.

A **higher-order function** is a function that either:

1. **Takes one or more functions as arguments** (parameters).
2. **Returns a function** as its result.

These functions are a key feature of functional programming and are widely used in JavaScript and other modern programming languages.

### Characteristics of Higher-Order Functions
- **Flexibility**: They allow functions to be passed around like variables.
- **Code Reusability**: They promote code that is modular and reusable.
- **Abstraction**: They enable abstraction over actions, not just values.

### Examples of Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript

#### 1. **A Function Taking Another Function as an Argument**
```javascript
function calculate(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

const add = (x, y) => x + y;
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;

console.log(calculate(add, 5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(calculate(multiply, 5, 3)); // Output: 15
```
Here, `calculate` is a higher-order function because it takes another function (`operation`) as an argument.

---

#### 2. **A Function Returning Another Function**
```javascript
function createMultiplier(multiplier) {
  return function (num) {
    return num * multiplier;
  };
}

const double = createMultiplier(2);
const triple = createMultiplier(3);

console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
console.log(triple(5)); // Output: 15
```
In this example, `createMultiplier` is a higher-order function because it returns another function.

---

#### 3. **Built-in Higher-Order Functions**
JavaScript provides several built-in higher-order functions, such as:
- `map()`
- `filter()`
- `reduce()`

Example with `map`:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const squares = numbers.map(num => num * num);
console.log(squares); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### Key Benefits of Higher-Order Functions
1. **Improved Code Readability**: They make it easier to express logic concisely.
2. **Modularity**: You can compose complex operations by combining smaller, reusable functions.
3. **Functional Programming**: They are essential for a functional programming paradigm.

Would you like to explore specific examples, or do you have a scenario in mind to apply a higher-order function?


### What is callback?

A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed inside that function.

Callbacks are a way to handle asynchronous operations like network requests, file reading, or user interactions in JavaScript.

JavaScript Higher Order Functions-FAQs

Can higher-order functions return other functions?

Yes, higher-order functions can return new functions. This is often used to create closures or specialized functions based on specific conditions.

What is the difference between a callback function and a higher-order function?

A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, while a higher-order function is the function that accepts, returns, or operates on other functions, including callbacks.

How do you pass a function as an argument in JavaScript?

You can pass a function as an argument by simply referencing its name without parentheses. For example, higherOrderFunction(callbackFunction).

What is a practical use case for higher-order functions?

Higher-order functions are useful for tasks like event handling, data transformation (e.g., map and filter), and creating function factories or decorators.

What is a closure, and how is it related to higher-order functions?

A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when executed outside of that scope. Higher-order functions often create closures when returning functions.

## Complex example of closure. 
Here’s a **complex example of closures**, demonstrating how closures can be used to implement **private variables and methods**, often seen in scenarios where encapsulation is needed:

---

### Example: **Bank Account System**
```javascript
function createBankAccount(initialBalance) {
  let balance = initialBalance; // Private variable

  return {
    deposit(amount) {
      if (amount > 0) {
        balance += amount;
        console.log(`Deposited: ₹${amount}. New Balance: ₹${balance}`);
      } else {
        console.log('Deposit amount must be positive.');
      }
    },
    withdraw(amount) {
      if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
        balance -= amount;
        console.log(`Withdrew: ₹${amount}. New Balance: ₹${balance}`);
      } else if (amount > balance) {
        console.log('Insufficient balance.');
      } else {
        console.log('Withdrawal amount must be positive.');
      }
    },
    checkBalance() {
      console.log(`Current Balance: ₹${balance}`);
    },
  };
}

// Create a new bank account
const myAccount = createBankAccount(1000);

myAccount.deposit(500);       // Deposited: ₹500. New Balance: ₹1500
myAccount.withdraw(200);      // Withdrew: ₹200. New Balance: ₹1300
myAccount.checkBalance();     // Current Balance: ₹1300

// Attempt to access the private variable
console.log(myAccount.balance); // Output: undefined (private variable)
```

---

### How This Uses Closures:
1. **Private Variable**: `balance` is a variable in the lexical scope of the `createBankAccount` function. It cannot be directly accessed from outside.
2. **Encapsulation**: The methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `checkBalance`) returned in the object are closures. They "remember" the `balance` variable from the outer function’s scope.
3. **Data Protection**: By not exposing `balance` directly, the account data is protected from accidental modification.

---

### Why This is Complex
- **Multiple Closures**: Each method (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `checkBalance`) is a closure that shares access to the same private `balance` variable.
- **Encapsulation via Closures**: This pattern mimics how private fields and methods work in object-oriented programming.

This approach is widely used in JavaScript to emulate **object-oriented principles** and is a powerful way to manage private data. Let me know if you'd like a further breakdown or similar examples!
