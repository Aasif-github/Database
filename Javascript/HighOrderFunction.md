What is HOD or Higher Order Function?

A higher-order function is a function that accepts a function as an argument or returns a function as a result.

Higher-order functions are useful because they allow you to compose functions together to create more complex functions.

What is callback?

A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed inside that function.

Callbacks are a way to handle asynchronous operations like network requests, file reading, or user interactions in JavaScript.

JavaScript Higher Order Functions-FAQs

Can higher-order functions return other functions?

Yes, higher-order functions can return new functions. This is often used to create closures or specialized functions based on specific conditions.

What is the difference between a callback function and a higher-order function?

A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, while a higher-order function is the function that accepts, returns, or operates on other functions, including callbacks.

How do you pass a function as an argument in JavaScript?

You can pass a function as an argument by simply referencing its name without parentheses. For example, higherOrderFunction(callbackFunction).

What is a practical use case for higher-order functions?

Higher-order functions are useful for tasks like event handling, data transformation (e.g., map and filter), and creating function factories or decorators.

What is a closure, and how is it related to higher-order functions?

A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when executed outside of that scope. Higher-order functions often create closures when returning functions.
