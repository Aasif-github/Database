# What is Javascript?
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language which support both object-orientation and functional programming styles. 

It is a single-threaded, dynamic typed language.
It is used for client-side and server-side web development.


## What is interpreted?
JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that the code is executed line by line.

## What is compiled?
JavaScript is a compiled language, which means that the code is compiled into machine code before it is executed.   

Great question! Here's a simple breakdown of **interpreted** vs **compiled** languages ‚Äî super useful for interviews:

---

### üîç **Interpreted Language:**
- Code is **executed line-by-line** by an interpreter at runtime.
- No separate compilation step before execution.
- **Slower**, but easier to test and debug.
- Examples: **JavaScript, Python, PHP**

> üß† *Think of it like reading a script out loud as you go.*

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Compiled Language:**
- Code is **translated (compiled)** into machine code **before** running.
- Generates an **executable file** (like `.exe`) by a compiler.
- **Faster** execution but takes longer to compile.
- Examples: **C, C++, Go, Rust, Java (partially ‚Äì compiled to bytecode)**

> üß† *Think of it like translating an entire book before giving it to someone to read.*

### üÜö Summary Table:

| Feature              | Interpreted Language | Compiled Language       |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Execution            | Line-by-line         | Whole program at once   |
| Speed                | Slower               | Faster                  |
| Debugging            | Easier               | Harder                  |
| Output               | No standalone file   | Creates executable file |
| Examples             | JS, Python, Ruby     | C, C++, Go              |

Let me know if you want analogies or how JavaScript fits in both worlds (since modern JS can be JIT compiled).

## What is JIT(Just in Time).
JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation) is a compilation process in which code is translated from an intermediate representation or a higher-level language (e.g., JavaScript or Java bytecode) into machine code at runtime, rather than prior to execution. This approach combines the benefits of both interpretation and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.

JIT compilers typically continuously analyze the code as it is executed, identifying parts of the code that are executed frequently (hot spots). If the speedup gains outweigh the compilation overhead, then the JIT compilers will compile those parts into machine code. The compiled code is then executed directly by the processor, which can result in significant performance improvements.

JIT is commonly used in modern web browsers to optimize the performance of JavaScript code.

## What is Dynamic Typing?
JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:

```js
let foo = 42; // foo is now a number
foo = "bar"; // foo is now a string
foo = true; // foo is now a boolean
```

JavaScript is also a `weakly typed language`, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.

```js
const foo = 42; // foo is a number
const result = foo + "1"; // JavaScript coerces foo to a string, so it can be concatenated with the other operand
console.log(result); // 421
```
## Type Coercion
As mentioned above, JavaScript is a `weakly typed language`. This means that you can often use a value of one type where another type is expected, and the language will convert it to the right type for you. To do so, JavaScript defines a handful of coercion rules.

Great question ‚Äî and one that comes up often in interviews!

---

### üîÑ **Type Coercion in JavaScript:**

> **Type coercion** is the automatic (or implicit) conversion of values from one data type to another by JavaScript.

---

### üìå Example:
```javascript
console.log("5" + 2); // "52"  ‚Üí Number 2 is coerced to a string
console.log("5" - 2); // 3     ‚Üí String "5" is coerced to a number
```

JavaScript **coerces** types based on the operator being used:
- `+` prefers **string concatenation** if one operand is a string.
- `-`, `*`, `/` force **numeric conversion**.

---

### üß† Interview Explanation:

> In JavaScript, type coercion happens automatically when values of different types are used together. This can lead to unexpected results if you're not careful.

---

### üß™ More Examples:

```javascript
console.log(true + 1);      // 2  ‚Üí true becomes 1
console.log(false + 1);     // 1  ‚Üí false becomes 0
console.log(null + 1);      // 1  ‚Üí null becomes 0
console.log(undefined + 1); // NaN ‚Üí undefined becomes NaN
```

---

## ‚úÖ Types of Coercion:
- **Implicit Coercion** ‚Üí Done automatically by JS
- **Explicit Coercion** ‚Üí Done manually by developer (e.g., `Number("5")`, `String(123)`)

## üí° **JavaScript Type Coercion Cheat Sheet**

### ‚úÖ **1. Implicit Coercion (done by JS automatically)**

| Expression           | Result   | Why                              |
|----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `"5" + 1`            | `"51"`   | `1` is coerced to string          |
| `"5" - 1`            | `4`      | `"5"` is coerced to number        |
| `true + 1`           | `2`      | `true` ‚Üí `1`                      |
| `false + 1`          | `1`      | `false` ‚Üí `0`                     |
| `null + 1`           | `1`      | `null` ‚Üí `0`                      |
| `undefined + 1`      | `NaN`    | `undefined` ‚Üí `NaN`               |
| `"10" * "2"`         | `20`     | both coerced to numbers           |
| `"10" > 5`           | `true`   | `"10"` is coerced to number       |
| `[] + []`            | `""`     | Both arrays become empty strings  |
| `[] + {}`            | `"[object Object]"` | string + object coerces |

### ‚úÖ **2. Explicit Coercion (done manually)**

| Method              | Example             | Result     |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------|
| `Number("123")`     | `Number("123")`     | `123`      |
| `String(123)`       | `String(123)`       | `"123"`    |
| `Boolean(0)`        | `Boolean(0)`        | `false`    |
| `Boolean("hello")`  | `Boolean("hello")`  | `true`     |
| `parseInt("42px")`  | `parseInt("42px")`  | `42`       |
| `parseFloat("3.14")`| `parseFloat("3.14")`| `3.14`     |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tricky Interview Gotchas**

| Expression               | Output  | Why? |
|--------------------------|---------|------|
| `[] == false`            | `true`  | empty array is truthy, but coercion kicks in |
| `"" == 0`                | `true`  | both coerced to number `0` |
| `null == undefined`      | `true`  | special case in JS spec |
| `NaN == NaN`             | `false` | `NaN` is never equal to anything, even itself |
| `[] == ![]`              | `true`  | `[]` is truthy, `![]` is false ‚Üí `[] == false` |

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practice (for Interviews):
Use **`===` (strict equality)** and **manual conversion** when needed to avoid unexpected results.
