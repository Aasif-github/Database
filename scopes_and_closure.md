# What is scope in js. explain in detail
In JavaScript, **scope** refers to the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in different parts of your code. Understanding scope is crucial for effective coding and avoiding common errors related to variable accessibility and conflicts. Let's break down the different types of scope in JavaScript:

### Types of Scope

1. **Global Scope**:
   - Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope.
   - Global variables are accessible from anywhere in the code.
   - Be cautious with global variables as they can lead to naming conflicts and unintended side effects.

**Example**:
```javascript
var globalVar = "I'm global!";

function showGlobalVar() {
    console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
}

showGlobalVar();
console.log(globalVar); // Also accessible
```

2. **Function Scope**:
   - Variables declared within a function are in the function scope.
   - They are accessible only within that function and not outside.
   - Function scope is created with the `function` keyword.

**Example**:
```javascript
function myFunction() {
    var functionVar = "I'm in a function!";
    console.log(functionVar); // Accessible
}

myFunction();
console.log(functionVar); // Uncaught ReferenceError: functionVar is not defined
```

3. **Block Scope**:
   - Variables declared with `let` or `const` within a block (e.g., inside a loop or conditional statement) are in block scope.
   - They are accessible only within that block.

**Example**:
```javascript
if (true) {
    let blockVar = "I'm in a block!";
    console.log(blockVar); // Accessible
}

console.log(blockVar); // Uncaught ReferenceError: blockVar is not defined
```

### Scope Chain

When a variable is referenced in JavaScript, the interpreter searches for the variable in the current scope. If it doesn't find the variable, it moves up to the next scope level. This process continues until the variable is found or the global scope is reached. This mechanism is known as the **scope chain**.

**Example**:
```javascript
var globalVar = "I'm global!";

function outerFunction() {
    var outerVar = "I'm in outer function!";
    
    function innerFunction() {
        var innerVar = "I'm in inner function!";
        console.log(innerVar); // Accessible
        console.log(outerVar); // Accessible (closure)
        console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
    }

    innerFunction();
    console.log(innerVar); // Uncaught ReferenceError: innerVar is not defined
}

outerFunction();
```
## Explaination
The `ReferenceError` occurs because `innerVar` is declared within the `innerFunction` and is therefore only accessible within the scope of `innerFunction`. Once `innerFunction` finishes executing, `innerVar` goes out of scope and is no longer accessible from the outside.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the code:

### Code Explanation

```javascript
var globalVar = "I'm global!";  // Global scope

function outerFunction() {
    var outerVar = "I'm in outer function!";  // Function (local) scope
    
    function innerFunction() {
        var innerVar = "I'm in inner function!";  // Function (local) scope within innerFunction
        console.log(innerVar);  // Accessible here within innerFunction
        console.log(outerVar);  // Accessible here due to closure
        console.log(globalVar);  // Accessible here from global scope
    }

    innerFunction();
    console.log(innerVar);  // Uncaught ReferenceError: innerVar is not defined
}

outerFunction();
```

### Scope Chain Explanation

1. **Global Scope**:
   - `globalVar` is declared in the global scope, making it accessible from anywhere in the script.

2. **outerFunction Scope**:
   - `outerVar` is declared within `outerFunction`, making it accessible only within `outerFunction` and any inner functions (due to closures).

3. **innerFunction Scope**:
   - `innerVar` is declared within `innerFunction`, making it accessible only within `innerFunction`.

### Execution Flow

- When `outerFunction` is called, `outerVar` is declared within its scope.
- `innerFunction` is then defined within `outerFunction`.
- When `innerFunction` is called:
  - `innerVar` is declared within `innerFunction`.
  - The `console.log` statements within `innerFunction` can access `innerVar`, `outerVar`, and `globalVar` because:
    - `innerVar` is within the local scope of `innerFunction`.
    - `outerVar` is in the scope of `outerFunction`, which `innerFunction` has access to due to the closure.
    - `globalVar` is in the global scope, accessible from anywhere.

### ReferenceError

- After `innerFunction` executes, the code attempts to log `innerVar` outside `innerFunction` within `outerFunction`:
  ```javascript
  console.log(innerVar);  // This line causes the ReferenceError
  ```
- `innerVar` is not accessible here because it was only defined within the local scope of `innerFunction`. This makes `innerVar` out of scope and therefore causes a `ReferenceError`.

### Summary

In summary, the `ReferenceError: innerVar is not defined` occurs because `innerVar` is only available within the `innerFunction` scope. Once you try to access `innerVar` outside of its scope, JavaScript cannot find the variable, leading to the error.

### Closures

Closures are functions that have access to their own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope. This allows for creating private variables and functions that cannot be accessed from outside the closure.

**Example**:
```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return function() {
        count += 1;
        return count;
    }
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

### Lexical Scope

JavaScript uses **lexical scoping**, meaning that the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code. Functions are executed using the scope chain that was in effect when they were defined.

**Example**:
```javascript
var globalVar = "I'm global!";

function outerFunction() {
    var outerVar = "I'm in outer function!";
    
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVar); // Accessible
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

const innerFunc = outerFunction();
innerFunc(); // Logs "I'm in outer function!"
```

### Summary

- **Global Scope**: Variables accessible from anywhere.
- **Function Scope**: Variables accessible only within the function.
- **Block Scope**: Variables accessible only within the block.
- **Scope Chain**: The process of looking up variables along the scope chain.
- **Closures**: Functions that retain access to their scope, the outer function's scope, and the global scope.
- **Lexical Scope**: Scope determined by the position of code in the source file.
