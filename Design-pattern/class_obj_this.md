## why we are passing attribute to constructor and using this. and assign attribute ?

```js
class Task {
  // Properties
  private id: number;
  private title: string;
  private description: string;
  private dueDate: Date;
  private completed: boolean;

  // Constructor
  constructor(taskInfo: {
    id: number;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    dueDate: Date;
  }) {
    this.id = taskInfo.id;
    this.title = taskInfo.title;
    this.description = taskInfo.description;
    this.dueDate = taskInfo.dueDate;
    this.completed = false; // By default, the task is not completed
  }
```

## Solution:
The purpose of passing attributes to the constructor and assigning them using `this` is to initialize an instance of a class with specific properties. Letâ€™s break it down:

### Why pass attributes to the constructor?
1. **Encapsulation of Initialization Logic**: The constructor is a special method that initializes a new instance of a class. By passing attributes as parameters, you allow the caller to specify the initial state of an object when it's created.
   ```typescript
   const myTask = new Task({
       id: 1,
       title: "Learn TypeScript",
       description: "Understand classes and interfaces",
       dueDate: new Date("2025-01-15")
   });
   ```

2. **Customization**: By accepting parameters, the constructor provides flexibility to initialize objects differently based on the input.

3. **Improved Readability and Usability**: Grouping related properties into a single parameter object (like `taskInfo`) makes the code cleaner and more maintainable, especially when there are multiple properties.

### Why use `this` to assign attributes?
1. **Instance-Specific Storage**: 
   - `this` refers to the current instance of the class. When you assign a value to `this.id`, you're storing that value as a property of the specific instance being created.
   ```typescript
   this.id = taskInfo.id;
   ```

2. **Persistence of Data**: Once assigned, these properties are tied to the instance and can be accessed or manipulated later.
   ```typescript
   console.log(myTask.title); // Outputs: "Learn TypeScript"
   ```

3. **Scope Distinction**: Using `this` ensures that the assignment is to the property of the instance, not a local variable or parameter. This avoids naming conflicts.

### Example Breakdown
```typescript
class Task {
  // Properties
  private id: number;
  private title: string;
  private description: string;
  private dueDate: Date;
  private completed: boolean;

  // Constructor
  constructor(taskInfo: { id: number; title: string; description: string; dueDate: Date }) {
    this.id = taskInfo.id; // Assigning the id property of the instance
    this.title = taskInfo.title; // Assigning the title property of the instance
    this.description = taskInfo.description; // Assigning the description property
    this.dueDate = taskInfo.dueDate; // Assigning the dueDate property
    this.completed = false; // Default value for completed
  }
}
```

### Key Benefits
- **Encapsulation**: Hides the implementation details of how the instance is initialized.
- **Clarity**: Makes it clear which properties belong to the instance.
- **Default Values**: Allows for default values (like `completed = false`) to be easily set.

Without this explicit assignment in the constructor, the class instance would have no values for its properties, and attempting to access them would lead to undefined behavior.
